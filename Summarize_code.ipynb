            "\r\n",
            "“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and\r\n",
            "my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,\r\n",
            "when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be\r\n",

            "pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He\r\n",
            "took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there\r\n",

            "whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_—not in the\r\n",
            "external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I\r\n",
            "could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The\r\n",
            "wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\r\n",
            "foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the\r\n",
            "soul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,\r\n",

            "those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great\r\n",

            "objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part\r\n",

            "doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the\r\n",

            "The novel is available as an ebook from project Gutenberg, and the narrator explains why it is better than previous editions. The chapter title comes from the text of the book itself. This edition contains a lot more content than previous versions. It's also totally free to read anywhere. Jane graduates from Gateshead on January 15th. She attends Lowood school for girls who are orphans. There she meets Helen in the school and they talk about religion and eventually get married. They have a few months of happiness together before Jane leaves for Lowood with her new friends. Rochester tries to make Jane feel guilty about the way she treated Helen when she was sick, so he sends her back to the orphanage to be with her family. At Lowood there are lots of lonely nights where Jane feels completely stranded, but at least she gets to draw portraits of Mrs. Rochester and write letters to her father telling him how wonderful Thornfield is. Then one day she hears Rochester laughing at her drawings, which makes her realize that he does have feelings for her after all. Aunt Flowe decides to throw a small party at which Jane is not allowed to attend. In the meantime Adele has come over to see Jane since Rochester doesn't let his daughter play with any of his other children. During the party Jane overhears Rochester tell Adele that he plans to take care of their daughter Adele and cut down on his household expenses. \n"
